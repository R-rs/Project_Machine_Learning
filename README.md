# Project_Machine_Learning
The main goal of this project was to explore the different **Machine Learning** models.


## Overview
This was a project under the Ironhack's bootcamp scope. It was an individual project on the 7th week of the bootcamp.
  
The subject of analysis was up to the student to decide, and to consolidate the different possibilities of Machine Learning Supervised, I decided to explore a **Regression** problem and associated it to a business model. 

## Dataset
The dataset, "marketing_campaign.csv", was obtained from Kaggle.  It corresponds to a dataset containing Customer Personality Analysis.

## Objective
Explore the different subjects:
- Feature Engineering (**One Hot Encoding**, **Label Encoding**, **Feature Scaling** and **Feature Selection**)
- **Train Test Split**
- Machine Learning Supervised (**KNN**, **Linear Regression**, **Decison Trees**)
- Ensemble Methods (**Bagging** and **Pasting**, **Random Forests**, **Boosting** such as **AdaBoost**, **Gradient Boost** and **XGBoost**)
- Hyperparameter Tuning (**Grid Search** and **Random Search**) and Cross Validation
